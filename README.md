💎 Gemstone Price Prediction

Gemstone Price Prediction is a data science project that performs exploratory data analysis and predicts gemstone prices using a linear regression model. The project focuses on understanding the relationship between gemstone attributes and price through manual preprocessing and statistical modeling.

Gemstone Price Prediction is a machine learning project designed to analyze gemstone characteristics and estimate their market price. It combines exploratory data analysis, manual feature engineering, and regression modeling to provide clear insights into pricing factors without using automated pipelines.
